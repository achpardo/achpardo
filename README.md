### Hello! I'm Anna

I am currently a PhD candidate at Michigan State University in the Horticulture department, working under [Dr. Robert VanBuren](https://www.vanburenlab.org/). I work on abiotic stress response in maize, resurrection plants, and other angiosperm extremophiles. I am particularly interested in leveraging publicly available data from previous studies to find biologically interesting patterns. After graduating from my PhD program in summer 2024, I plan to seek a computational biology position in the agricultural biotechnology industry.
